After six years as a Physiotherapist I decided it was time to take on a new challenge in the tech industry that gained by attention rapidly. 

I am a full-stack junior software developer, having recently graduated from Makers Academy. 

Whilst working as a Physiotherapist I started to develop an interest in tech. I found myself highly i

As a recent graduate from Makers Academy, I'm currently looking for a career in London as a full-stack developer with an ambitious company that will support me in learning new skills. Working on a product that I can get excited about is crucial.  

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what exictes you about tech.

Tech Skills: Test Driven Development, Pair-Programming, Agile, XP Values, Git Workflow

## Skills

**Problem solving**

Whilst working as a physiotherapist you are constantly challenged with problems. This was one aspect I enjoyed most about physiotherapy. Solving problems, big or small is something I thrive on. Since becoming a developer I have found the approach to tackle problems was quite similar in how to diagnose a condition. For example, with complex conditions I would break down the main issue into smaller problems. This allowed for clear visibility and ability to prioritizse probelms. This made goal setting and rehabilitation more efficient. I have found whilst learning how to become a programmer I take a similar approach. To overcome the problem or bug breaking down the issue is critical to solving what is wrong. 

**Communication**

As a health professional excellent written and verbal communication is imperative.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
