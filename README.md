After six years as a Physiotherapist, I decided it was time to take on a new challenge and pursue a career in the tech industry. The freedom in the ability to solve problems was what drove me to code - there are only so many ways you can prescribe an exercise. 

As a recent graduate from Makers, I am currently looking for a career in London as a **full-stack developer** with an ambitious company that embraces professional development. 

Tech Skills: Test Driven Development, Object Orientated Programming, Pair-Programming, Agile, XP Values, Git Workflow, Team Work

## Skills

**Problem Solver**

Whilst working as a physiotherapist I was constantly challenged with different problems. This was one aspect I enjoyed most about Physiotherapy. Solving problems, big or small is something I thrive on. Since becoming a developer, I have found the approach to tackle problems or bugs is quite similar in how to diagnose a condition. For example, with complex injuries, I would break down the main issue into smaller problems. This allowed for clear visibility and the ability to prioritise problems in the same way it would whilst programming.

**Fast Learner and Adaptable**

Striving to become a software developer, I have been challenged to learn new languages and frameworks in just a few weeks. For example, without any prior knowledge to Javascript, I was able to create a single page web app of a [thermostat][9] in just a few days.

I have always been flexible and ready to take on new challenges. For example, A recent physiotherapy role required working independently in a remote clinic. Not only did this require me to adapt to the patient management software quickly, but I also had to learn how to micromanage the clinic in terms of ordering supplies, liaising with numerous insurance bodies and adhere to company-wide marketing strategies including gaining 5 star Google reviews. This also required excellent communication and interpersonal skills to work efficiently individually and within a team.
